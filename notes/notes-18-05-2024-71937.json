[{"title":"The Weeknd","content":"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer-songwriter.[2][3] He is known for his unconventional music production, artistic reinventions, and signature use of the falsetto register.\r\n\r\nTesfaye began releasing music anonymously in 2009. After co-founding the record label XO, he released three mixtapes in 2011, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence. The mixtapes gained recognition for its style of contemporary and alternative R&B, alongside the mystery surrounding his identity. He signed with Republic Records in 2012, reissuing the mixtapes the same year as a compilation album titled Trilogy, and releasing his debut studio album, Kiss Land, in 2013. After a string of collaborations and film soundtrack contributions between 2013 and 2014, Tesfaye began to transition from alternative R&B in favor of a pop sound with his second and third studio albums, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016), which both reached the top of the US Billboard 200. Beauty Behind the Madness included his first two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", and Starboy spawned two more chart-toppers, its title track featuring Daft Punk, and after a remix with Ariana Grande, \"Die for You\".","type":"note","favoris":0,"filename":"notes\/notes-18-05-2024-71937.json","date":"18-05-2024 19:13:52"}]
